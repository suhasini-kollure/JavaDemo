//A deadlock occurs in concurrent programming when two or more threads are blocked forever,
// each waiting for the other to release a resource.
// This typically happens when threads hold locks on resources and request additional locks held by other threads.
// For example, Thread A holds Lock 1 and waits for Lock 2, while Thread B holds Lock 2 and waits for Lock 1.
// Since neither thread can proceed, they remain stuck in a deadlock state.
// Deadlocks can severely impact system performance and are challenging to debug and resolve in multi-threaded applications.

//A Read-Write Lock is a concurrency control mechanism that allows multiple threads to read shared data
// simultaneously while restricting write access to a single thread at a time.
// This lock type, provided by the ReentrantReadWriteLock class in Java, optimizes performance in scenarios with
// frequent read operations and infrequent writes.
// Multiple readers can acquire the read lock without blocking each other, but when a thread needs to write,
// it must acquire the write lock, ensuring exclusive access. This prevents data inconsistency while improving
// read efficiency compared to traditional locks, which block all access during write operations.
